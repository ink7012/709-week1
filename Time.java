/* Make the program calculate and display the number of seconds since midnight.

Calculate and display the number of seconds remaining in the day.

Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has passed. You might run into problems when computing percentages with integers, so consider using floating-point.

Change the values of hour, minute, and second to reflect the current time. 

Then write code to compute the elapsed time since you started working on this exercise. */
